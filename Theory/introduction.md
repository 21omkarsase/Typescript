**What is Typescript**
    
    TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. It was created and is maintained by Microsoft and is an open-source programming language.

**Advantages**
    
    1.Static Typing : 
    _________________
     TypeScript provides a static type system that allows for catching type-related errors at compile-time instead of runtime, which can help to reduce bugs and improve code quality.
    
    2.Code readability and maintainability: 
    ________________________________________
     TypeScript's syntax and features such as interfaces, classes, and modules make code easier to read and maintain, especially for larger projects.
     
    3.Better scalability: 
    4.Better collaboration: 
    5.JavaScript compatibility:
    6.IDE support
    

**Disadvantages**

    1.Steep Learning Curve :
    ________________________
     Developers who are new to TypeScript may need to invest additional time and effort to learn the language and its tools.
    
    2.Code Overhead :
     ________________
     TypeScript can increase the size of the codebase due to the additional type information and other language constructs. This can lead to longer build times and potentially slower performance.
     
    3.Lack of Community Support :
